	So far i have been having a bit of a hard time with remembering all of the codes and terms. This is like learning a whole new language. A syllabus would help sooo much! hhmm. Maybe then i could create flashcards and study the commonly used terms and codes. I have found that I am a hands on type of learner and so far I am not sure if the structure of the class is helping me learn. I feel like we have been jumping from one thing to another. hopefully in the wees ahead it will be better and thing will become clearer.
