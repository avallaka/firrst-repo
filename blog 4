We are in week four now and i feel good. i just finished up chapter 2 and i will be going back to it and using it as a study guide for myself. i will probably create some flash cards for myself and come up with a method that will help me remember the codes and terms. we have new partners this week. i have not had a chance to work with mines but hopefully in the future i will. I am slowly but surely picking out websites and apps that i feel will help me learn code in the best way. I love learning new thing and in the weeks ahead i hope to learn more and expand my knowledge more. I have been having a hard time finding study time outside of class and if i can set aside a chunk of time throughout the week where i can study i feel like i can stay ahead in the class and maybe even help others when they are stuck!.
