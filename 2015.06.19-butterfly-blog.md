1st blog post.


	Hello world this is my first blog post! I have been learning code since the 15th of june and it has been a fun yet hectic experience. I love the fact that someone else has created this code before us because in a lot of ways it makes it easier for us to learn the program. i have made friends and work partners so far while i have been in the class. I like working in groups on a common goal. It makes the weight of the task at hand much easier to share. everyone is good at certain things and i believe with this program we can learn how to work together in the professional world and make projects flow with intelligence and professionalism. I am so glad that i have the opportunity because I know that it can open many doors for me and my family.
