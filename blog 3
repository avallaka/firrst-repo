	Hello! we are in our third week and now we have been paired with partners that our instructor believes are compatible with us and our individual learning styles. Working through the worksheets is ok, but i still feel like we should have learned the material a little more and then it would have been a bit easier to get through. I still feel good about the program. We also had our first moch project management run and i loved it so much! I found myself taking control and throwing out ideas and also using other people's ideas to come up with a better idea as a group. I also got to be creative which i loved as well. Looking forward to moving ahead in the class. still have not gotten a syllabus and i really feel like that would help me if i had one. Maybe I should create one.
